# Athena error catalog<a name="error-reference"></a>

Athena provides standardized error information to help you understand failed queries and take steps after a query failure occurs\. The `AthenaError` feature includes an `ErrorCategory` field and an `ErrorType` field\. `ErrorCategory` specifies whether the cause of the failed query is due to system error, user error, or other error\. `ErrorType` provides more granular information regarding the source of the failure\. By combining the two fields, you can get a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding and causes for the specific error that occurred\.

## Error category<a name="error-reference-error-category"></a>

The following table lists the Athena error category values and their meanings\.
