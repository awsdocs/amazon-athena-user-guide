|  Released the new version of the ODBC driver with support for Athena workgroups\.  |  To download the ODBC driver version 1\.0\.5 and its documentation, see [Connecting to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md)\. There are no changes to the ODBC driver connection string when you use tags on workgroups\. To use tags, upgrade to the latest version of the ODBC driver, which is this current version\. This driver version lets you use [Athena API workgroup actions](workgroups-api-list.md) to create and manage workgroups, and [Athena API tag actions](tags-operations.md) to add, list, or remove tags on workgroups\. Before you begin, make sure that you have resource\-level permissions in IAM for actions on workgroups and tags\.   | March 5, 2019 | 
| Added tag support for workgroups in Amazon Athena\.  |  A tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define\. When you tag a workgroup, you assign custom metadata to it\. For example, create a workgroup for each cost center\. Then, by adding tags to these workgroups, you can track your Athena spending for each cost center\. For more information, see [Using Tags for Billing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.  | February 22, 2019 |

| Added support for workgroups\. |   Use workgroups to separate users, teams, applications, or workloads, and to set limits on amount of data each query or the entire workgroup can process\. Because workgroups act as IAM resources, you can use resource\-level permissions to control access to a specific workgroup\. You can also view query\-related metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, control query costs by configuring limits on the amount of data scanned, create thresholds, and trigger actions, such as Amazon SNS alarms, when these thresholds are breached\. For more information, see [Using Workgroups for Running Queries](workgroups.md) and [Controlling Costs and Monitoring Queries with CloudWatch Metrics and Events](control-limits.md)\.  | February 18, 2019 |
