# SQL reference for Athena<a name="ddl-sql-reference"></a>

Amazon Athena supports a subset of Data Definition Language \(DDL\) and Data Manipulation Language \(DML\) statements, functions, operators, and data types\. With some exceptions, Athena DDL is based on [HiveQL DDL](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL)\. For information about Athena engine versions, see [Athena engine versioning](engine-versions.md)\.
