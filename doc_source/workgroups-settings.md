# Workgroup settings<a name="workgroups-settings"></a>

Each workgroup has the following settings:
+ A unique name\. It can contain from 1 to 128 characters, including alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores\. After you create a workgroup, you cannot change its name\. You can, however, create a new workgroup with the same settings and a different name\.
+ Settings that apply to all queries running in the workgroup\. They include: 
  + **A location in Amazon S3 for storing query results** for all queries that run in this workgroup\. This location must exist before you specify it for the workgroup when you create it\. For information about creating an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Create a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)\.
  + **Bucket owner control of query results** – Whether the owner of the Amazon S3 query results bucket has full control over new objects that are written to the bucket\. For example, if your query result location is owned by another account, you can grant ownership and full control over your query results to the other account\.
  + **Expected bucket owner** – The ID of the AWS account that you expect to be the owner of the query results bucket\. This is an added security measure\. If the account ID of the bucket owner does not match the ID that you specify here, attempts to output to the bucket will fail\. For in\-depth information, see [Verifying bucket ownership with bucket owner condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-owner-condition.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*\.\.
**Note**  
The expected bucket owner setting applies only to the Amazon S3 output location that you specify for Athena query results\. It does not apply to other Amazon S3 locations like data source locations in external Amazon S3 buckets, `CTAS` and `INSERT INTO` destination table locations, `UNLOAD` statement output locations, operations to spill buckets for federated queries, or `SELECT` queries run against a table in another account\.
  + **An encryption setting**, if you use encryption for all workgroup queries\. You can encrypt only all queries in a workgroup, not just some of them\. It is best to create separate workgroups to contain queries that are either encrypted or not encrypted\.

In addition, you can [override client\-side settings](workgroups-settings-override.md)\. Before the release of workgroups, you could specify results location and encryption options as parameters in the JDBC or ODBC driver, or in the **Properties** tab in the Athena console\. These settings could also be specified directly via the API operations\. These settings are known as "client\-side settings"\. With workgroups, you can configure these settings at the workgroup level and enforce control over them\. This spares your users from setting them individually\. If you select the **Override Client\-Side Settings**, queries use the workgroup settings and ignore the client\-side settings\. 

If **Override Client\-Side Settings** is selected, the user is notified on the console that their settings have changed\. If workgroup settings are enforced this way, users can omit corresponding client\-side settings\. In this case, if you run queries in the console, the workgroup's settings are used for them even if any queries have client\-side settings\. Also, if you run queries in this workgroup through the command line interface, API operations, or the drivers, any settings that you specified are overwritten by the workgroup's settings\. This affects the query results location and encryption\. To check which settings are used for the workgroup, [view workgroup's details](workgroups-create-update-delete.md#viewing-details-workgroups)\.

You can also [set query limits](control-limits.md) for queries in workgroups\.
