For information about each integration, see the following sections\.

**AWS CloudFormation**    
*Data Catalog*  
Reference topic: [AWS::Athena::DataCatalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-athena-datacatalog.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*

Specify Athena workgroups using AWS CloudFormation\. Use Athena workgroups to isolate queries for you or your group from other queries in the same account\. For more information, see [Using workgroups to control query access and costs](manage-queries-control-costs-with-workgroups.md) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide* and [CreateWorkGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_CreateWorkGroup.html) in the *Amazon Athena API Reference*\.

**AWS CloudTrail**  
Reference topic: [Querying AWS CloudTrail logs](cloudtrail-logs.md)  
Using Athena with CloudTrail logs is a powerful way to enhance your analysis of AWS service activity\. For example, you can use queries to identify trends and further isolate activity by attribute, such as source IP address or user\. You can create tables for querying logs directly from the CloudTrail console, and use those tables to run queries in Athena\. For more information, see [Using the CloudTrail console to create an Athena table for CloudTrail logs ](cloudtrail-logs.md#create-cloudtrail-table-ct)\.

**Elastic Load Balancing**  
Reference topic: [Querying Application Load Balancer logs](application-load-balancer-logs.md)  
Querying Application Load Balancer logs allows you to see the source of traffic, latency, and bytes transferred to and from Elastic Load Balancing instances and backend applications\. For more information, see [Creating the table for ALB logs](application-load-balancer-logs.md#create-alb-table)\.  
Reference topic: [Querying Classic Load Balancer logs](elasticloadbalancer-classic-logs.md)  
Query Classic Load Balancer logs to analyze and understand traffic patterns to and from Elastic Load Balancing instances and backend applications\. You can see the source of traffic, latency, and bytes transferred\. For more information, see [Creating the Table for ELB Logs](elasticloadbalancer-classic-logs.md#create-elb-table)\.

**AWS Glue Data Catalog**  
Reference topic: [Integration with AWS Glue](glue-athena.md)   
Athena integrates with the AWS Glue Data Catalog, which offers a persistent metadata store for your data in Amazon S3\. This allows you to create tables and query data in Athena based on a central metadata store available throughout your Amazon Web Services account and integrated with the ETL and data discovery features of AWS Glue\. For more information, see [Integration with AWS Glue](glue-athena.md) and [What is AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html) in the *AWS Glue Developer Guide*\.

**AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)**  
Reference topic: [Actions for Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonathena.html)  
You can use Athena API actions in IAM permission policies\. For more information, see [Actions for Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonathena.html) and [Identity and access management in Athena](security-iam-athena.md)\.

**Amazon QuickSight**  
Reference topic: [Connecting to Amazon Athena with ODBC and JDBC drivers](athena-bi-tools-jdbc-odbc.md)  
Athena integrates with Amazon QuickSight for easy data visualization\. You can use Athena to generate reports or to explore data with business intelligence tools or SQL clients connected with a JDBC or an ODBC driver\. For more information about Amazon QuickSight, see [What is Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/welcome.html) in the *Amazon QuickSight User Guide*\.

You can use Amazon Athena to query Amazon S3 inventory using standard SQL\. You can use Amazon S3 inventory to audit and report on the replication and encryption status of your objects for business, compliance, and regulatory needs\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*\.

**AWS Step Functions**  
Reference topic: [Call Athena with Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-athena.html) in the *AWS Step Functions Developer Guide*  
Call Athena with AWS Step Functions\. AWS Step Functions can control select AWS services directly using the [Amazon States Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html)\. You can use Step Functions with Athena to start and stop query execution, get query results, run ad\-hoc or scheduled data queries, and retrieve results from data lakes in Amazon S3\. For more information, see the [AWS Step Functions Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/)\.   
**Video: Orchestrate Amazon Athena Queries using AWS Step Functions**  
The following video demonstrates how to use Amazon Athena and AWS Step Functions to run a regularly scheduled Athena query and generate a corresponding report\.
