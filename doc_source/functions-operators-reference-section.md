# DML queries, functions, and operators<a name="functions-operators-reference-section"></a>

Athena DML query statements are based on [Presto 0\.172](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.172/index.html) for Athena engine version 1 and [Presto 0\.217](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.217/index.html) for Athena engine version 2\. For information about Athena engine versions, see [Athena engine versioning](engine-versions.md)\.

For links to subsections of the Presto function documentation, see [Functions](presto-functions.md)\. 

Athena does not support all of Presto's features, and there are some significant differences\. For more information, see the topics for specific statements in this section and [Considerations and limitations](other-notable-limitations.md)\.

For information about DDL statements, see [DDL statements](language-reference.md)\. For a list of unsupported DDL statements, see [Unsupported DDL](unsupported-ddl.md)\.
