# Workgroup settings override client\-side settings<a name="workgroups-settings-override"></a>

The **Create workgroup** and **Edit workgroup** dialogs have a field titled **Override client\-side settings**\. This field is unselected by default\. Depending on whether you select it, Athena does the following:
+ If **Override client\-side settings** is not selected, workgroup settings are not enforced at the client level\. When the override client\-side settings option is not selected for the workgroup, Athena uses the client's settings for all queries that run in the workgroup, including the settings for query results location, expected bucket owner, encryption, and control of objects written to the query results bucket\. Each user can specify their own settings in the **Settings** menu on the console\. If the client\-side settings are not set, the workgroup\-wide settings apply\. If you use the AWS CLI, API actions, or JDBC and ODBC drivers to run queries in a workgroup that does not override client\-side settings, your queries use the settings that you specify in your queries\.
+ If **Override client\-side settings** is selected, workgroup settings are enforced at the client level\. When the override client\-side settings option is selected for the workgroup, Athena uses the workgroup's settings for all queries that run in the workgroup, including the settings for query results location, expected bucket owner, encryption, and control of objects written to the query results bucket\. Workgroup settings override any client\-side settings that you specify for a query when you use the console, API actions, or JDBC or ODBC drivers\. 

  If you override client\-side settings, then the next time that you or any workgroup user opens the Athena console, Athena notifies you that queries in the workgroup use the workgroup's settings, and prompts you to acknowledge this change\.
**Important**  
If you use API actions, the AWS CLI, or the JDBC and ODBC drivers to run queries in a workgroup that overrides client\-side settings, make sure that you either omit the client\-side settings in your queries or update them to match the settings of the workgroup\. If you specify client\-side settings in your queries but run them in a workgroup that overrides the settings, the queries will run, but the workgroup settings will be used\.
