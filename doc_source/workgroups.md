# Using Workgroups for Running Queries<a name="workgroups"></a>

We recommend using workgroups to isolate queries for teams, applications, or different workloads\. For example, you may create separate workgroups for two different teams in your organization\. You can also separate workloads\. For example, you can create two independent workgroups, one for automated scheduled applications, such as report generation, and another for ad\-hoc usage by analysts\. You can switch between workgroups\.
