# Creating a table from query results \(CTAS\)<a name="ctas"></a>

A `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` \(CTAS\) query creates a new table in Athena from the results of a `SELECT` statement from another query\. Athena stores data files created by the CTAS statement in a specified location in Amazon S3\. For syntax, see [ CREATE TABLE AS ](create-table-as.md)\.

Use CTAS queries to: 
+ Create tables from query results in one step, without repeatedly querying raw data sets\. This makes it easier to work with raw data sets\.
+ Transform query results and migrate tables into other table formats such as Apache Iceberg\. This improves query performance and reduces query costs in Athena\. For information, see [Creating Iceberg tables](querying-iceberg-creating-tables.md)\.
+ Transform query results into storage formats such as Parquet and ORC\. This improves query performance and reduces query costs in Athena\. For information, see [Columnar storage formats](columnar-storage.md)\.
+ Create copies of existing tables that contain only the data you need\.
