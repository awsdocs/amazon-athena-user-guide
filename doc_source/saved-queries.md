# Using saved queries<a name="saved-queries"></a>

You can use the Athena console to save, edit, run, rename, and delete the queries that you create in the query editor\.

## Considerations and limitations<a name="saved-queries-considerations-and-limitations"></a>
+ You can update the name, description, and query text of saved queries\.
+ You can only update the queries in your own account\.
+ You cannot change the workgroup or database to which the query belongs\.
+ Athena does not keep a history of query modifications\. If you want to keep a particular version of a query, save it with a different name\.
