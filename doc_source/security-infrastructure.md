# Infrastructure Security in Athena<a name="security-infrastructure"></a>

As a managed service, Amazon Athena is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

You use AWS published API calls to access Athena through the network\. Clients must support TLS \(Transport Layer Security\) 1\.0\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\. Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

Use IAM policies to restrict access to Athena operations\. Whenever you use IAM policies, make sure that you follow IAM best practices\. For more information, see [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

Athena [managed policies](managed-policies.md) are easy to use, and are automatically updated with the required actions as the service evolves\. Customer\-managed and inline policies allow you to fine tune policies by specifying more granular Athena actions within the policy\. Grant appropriate access to the Amazon S3 location of the data\. For detailed information and scenarios about how to grant Amazon S3 access, see [Example Walkthroughs: Managing Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-walkthroughs-managing-access.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\. For more information and an example of which Amazon S3 actions to allow, see the example bucket policy in [Cross\-Account Access](cross-account-permissions.md)\.
