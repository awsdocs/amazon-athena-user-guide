# Amazon Athena OpenSearch connector<a name="connectors-opensearch"></a>

The Amazon Athena OpenSearch connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with your OpenSearch instances so that you can use SQL to query your OpenSearch data\. This connector works with the Amazon OpenSearch Service or any OpenSearch\-compatible endpoint that is configured with OpenSearch version 7\.0 or higher\.

**Note**  
Due to a known issue, the OpenSearch connector cannot be used with a VPC\.

If you have Lake Formation enabled in your account, the IAM role for your Athena federated Lambda connector that you deployed in the AWS Serverless Application Repository must have read access in Lake Formation to the AWS Glue Data Catalog\.

## Prerequisites<a name="connectors-opensearch-prerequisites"></a>
+ Deploy the connector to your AWS account using the Athena console or the AWS Serverless Application Repository\. For more information, see [Deploying a data source connector](connect-to-a-data-source-lambda.md) or [Using the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md)\.

## Terms<a name="connectors-opensearch-terms"></a>

The following terms relate to the OpenSearch connector\.
+ **Domain** – A name that this connector associates with the endpoint of your OpenSearch instance\. The domain is also used as the database name\. For OpenSearch instances defined within the Amazon OpenSearch Service, the domain is auto\-discoverable\. For other instances, you must provide a mapping between the domain name and endpoint\.
+ **Index** – A database table defined in your OpenSearch instance\.
+ **Mapping** – If an index is a database table, then the mapping is its schema \(that is, the definitions of its fields and attributes\)\.

  This connector supports both metadata retrieval from the OpenSearch instance and from the AWS Glue Data Catalog\. If the connector finds a AWS Glue database and table that match your OpenSearch domain and index names, the connector attempts to use them for schema definition\. We recommend that you create your AWS Glue table so that it is a superset of all fields in your OpenSearch index\.
+ **Document** – A record within a database table\.

## Parameters<a name="connectors-opensearch-parameters"></a>

Use the Lambda environment variables in this section to configure the OpenSearch connector\.
+ **spill\_bucket** – Specifies the Amazon S3 bucket for data that exceeds Lambda function limits\.
+ **spill\_prefix** – \(Optional\) Defaults to a subfolder in the specified `spill_bucket` called `athena-federation-spill`\. We recommend that you configure an Amazon S3 [storage lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) on this location to delete spills older than a predetermined number of days or hours\.
+ **spill\_put\_request\_headers** – \(Optional\) A JSON encoded map of request headers and values for the Amazon S3 `putObject` request that is used for spilling \(for example, `{"x-amz-server-side-encryption" : "AES256"}`\)\. For other possible headers, see [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*\.
+ **kms\_key\_id** – \(Optional\) By default, any data that is spilled to Amazon S3 is encrypted using the AES\-GCM authenticated encryption mode and a randomly generated key\. To have your Lambda function use stronger encryption keys generated by KMS like `a7e63k4b-8loc-40db-a2a1-4d0en2cd8331`, you can specify a KMS key ID\.
+ **disable\_spill\_encryption** – \(Optional\) When set to `True`, disables spill encryption\. Defaults to `False` so that data that is spilled to S3 is encrypted using AES\-GCM – either using a randomly generated key or KMS to generate keys\. Disabling spill encryption can improve performance, especially if your spill location uses [server\-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html)\.
+ **disable\_glue** – \(Optional\) If present and set to true, the connector does not attempt to retrieve supplemental metadata from AWS Glue\.
+ **query\_timeout\_cluster** – The timeout period, in seconds, for cluster health queries used in the generation of parallel scans\.
+ **query\_timeout\_search** – The timeout period, in seconds, for search queries used in the retrieval of documents from an index\.
+ **auto\_discover\_endpoint** – Boolean\. The default is `true`\. When you use the Amazon OpenSearch Service and set this parameter to true, the connector can auto\-discover your domains and endpoints by calling the appropriate describe or list API operations on the OpenSearch Service\. For any other type of OpenSearch instance \(for example, self\-hosted\), you must specify the associated domain endpoints in the `domain_mapping` variable\. If `auto_discover_endpoint=true`, the connector uses AWS credentials to authenticate to the OpenSearch Service\. Otherwise, the connector retrieves user name and password credentials from AWS Secrets Manager through the `domain_mapping` variable\.
+ **domain\_mapping** – Used only when `auto_discover_endpoint` is set to false and defines the mapping between domain names and their associated endpoints\. The `domain_mapping` variable can accommodate multiple OpenSearch endpoints in the following format:

  ```
  domain1=endpoint1,domain2=endpoint2,domain3=endpoint3,...       
  ```

  For the purpose of authenticating to an OpenSearch endpoint, the connector supports substitution strings injected using the format `${SecretName}:` with user name and password retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager\. The colon \(:\) at the end of the expression serves as a separator from the rest of the endpoint\.

  The following example uses the `opensearch-creds` secret\.

  ```
  movies=https://${opensearch-creds}:search-movies-ne...qu.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com     
  ```

  At runtime, `${opensearch-creds}` is rendered as the user name and password, as in the following example\.

  ```
  movies=https://myusername@mypassword:search-movies-ne...qu.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com
  ```

  In the `domain_mapping` parameter, each domain\-endpoint pair can use a different secret\. The secret itself must be specified in the format *user\_name*@*password*\. Although the password may contain embedded `@` signs, the first `@` serves as a separator from *user\_name*\.

  It is also important to note that the comma \(,\) and equal sign \(=\) are used by this connector as separators for the domain\-endpoint pairs\. For this reason, you should not use them anywhere inside the stored secret\.

## Setting up databases and tables in AWS Glue<a name="connectors-opensearch-setting-up-databases-and-tables-in-aws-glue"></a>

The connector obtains metadata information by using AWS Glue or OpenSearch\. You can set up an AWS Glue table as a supplemental metadata definition source\. To enable this feature, define a AWS Glue database and table that match the domain and index of the source that you are supplementing\. The connector can also take advantage of metadata definitions stored in the OpenSearch instance by retrieving the mapping for the specified index\.

### Defining metadata for arrays in OpenSearch<a name="connectors-opensearch-defining-metadata-for-arrays-in-opensearch"></a>

OpenSearch does not have a dedicated array data type\. Any field can contain zero or more values so long as they are of the same data type\. If you want to use OpenSearch as your metadata definition source, you must define a `_meta` property for all indices used with Athena for the fields that to be considered a list or array\. If you fail to complete this step, queries return only the first element in the list field\. When you specify the `_meta` property, field names should be fully qualified for nested JSON structures \(for example, `address.street`, where `street` is a nested field inside an `address` structure\)\.

The following example defines `actor` and `genre` lists in the `movies` table\.

```
PUT movies/_mapping 
{ 
  "_meta": { 
    "actor": "list", 
    "genre": "list" 
  } 
}
```

### Data types<a name="connectors-opensearch-data-types"></a>

The OpenSearch connector can extract metadata definitions from either AWS Glue or the OpenSearch instance\. The connector uses the mapping in the following table to convert the definitions to Apache Arrow data types, including the points noted in the section that follows\.


****  

| OpenSearch | Apache Arrow | AWS Glue | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| text, keyword, binary | VARCHAR | string | 
| long | BIGINT | bigint | 
| scaled\_float | BIGINT | SCALED\_FLOAT\(\.\.\.\) | 
| integer | INT | int | 
| short | SMALLINT | smallint | 
| byte | TINYINT | tinyint | 
| double | FLOAT8 | double | 
| float, half\_float | FLOAT4 | float | 
| boolean | BIT | boolean | 
| date, date\_nanos | DATEMILLI | timestamp | 
| JSON structure | STRUCT | STRUCT | 
| \_meta \(for information, see the section [Defining metadata for arrays in OpenSearch](#connectors-opensearch-defining-metadata-for-arrays-in-opensearch)\.\) | LIST | ARRAY | 

#### Notes on data types<a name="connectors-opensearch-data-type-considerations-and-limitations"></a>
+ Currently, the connector supports only the OpenSearch and AWS Glue data\-types listed in the preceding table\.
+ A `scaled_float` is a floating\-point number scaled by a fixed double scaling factor and represented as a `BIGINT` in Apache Arrow\. For example, 0\.756 with a scaling factor of 100 is rounded to 76\.
+ To define a `scaled_float` in AWS Glue, you must select the `array` column type and declare the field using the format SCALED\_FLOAT\(*scaling\_factor*\)\.

  The following examples are valid:

  ```
  SCALED_FLOAT(10.51) 
  SCALED_FLOAT(100) 
  SCALED_FLOAT(100.0)
  ```

  The following examples are not valid:

  ```
  SCALED_FLOAT(10.) 
  SCALED_FLOAT(.5)
  ```
+ When converting from `date_nanos` to `DATEMILLI`, nanoseconds are rounded to the nearest millisecond\. Valid values for `date` and `date_nanos` include, but are not limited to, the following formats:

  ```
  "2020-05-18T10:15:30.123456789" 
  "2020-05-15T06:50:01.123Z" 
  "2020-05-15T06:49:30.123-05:00" 
  1589525370001 (epoch milliseconds)
  ```
+ An OpenSearch `binary` is a string representation of a binary value encoded using `Base64` and is converted to a `VARCHAR`\.

## Running SQL queries<a name="connectors-opensearch-running-sql-queries"></a>

The following are examples of DDL queries that you can use with this connector\. In the examples, *function\_name* corresponds to the name of your Lambda function, *domain* is the name of the domain that you want to query, and *index* is the name of your index\.

```
SHOW DATABASES in `lambda:function_name`
```

```
SHOW TABLES in `lambda:function_name`.domain
```

```
DESCRIBE `lambda:function_name`.domain.index
```

## Performance<a name="connectors-opensearch-performance"></a>

The Athena OpenSearch connector supports shard\-based parallel scans\. The connector uses cluster health information retrieved from the OpenSearch instance to generate multiple requests for a document search query\. The requests are split for each shard and run concurrently\.

The connector also pushes down predicates as part of its document search queries\. The following example query and predicate shows how the connector uses predicate push down\.

**Query**

```
SELECT * FROM "lambda:elasticsearch".movies.movies 
WHERE year >= 1955 AND year <= 1962 OR year = 1996
```

**Predicate**

```
(_exists_:year) AND year:([1955 TO 1962] OR 1996)
```
